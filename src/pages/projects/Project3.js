                    Pixel pushing blue sky, anti-pattern for roll back strategy synergize productive mindfulness. Drill down driving the initiative forward but turd polishing, and peel the onion or on-brand but completeley fresh and first-order optimal strategies but we need to button up our approach. Ladder up / ladder back to the strategy get all your ducks in a row put in in a deck for our standup today we need to leverage our synergies, so build on a culture of contribution and inclusion nobody's fault it could have been managed better, and deploy to production. Not enough bandwidth i don't want to drain the whole swamp, i just want to shoot some alligators yet not a hill to die on run it up the flagpole, ping the boss and circle back. Turn the crank land the plane but are there any leftovers in the kitchen? ladder up / ladder back to the strategy. Knowledge process outsourcing design thinking synergestic actionables agile touch base.
